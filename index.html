								<p>CivicConnect is a Communications-Based Civic Project that aims to shorten the contact lines between congressional representatives and the populations they represent. We aim to allow Americans to connect with their government and make changes without giving up their daily routines. We provide an easy-to-use platform to message both House and Senate representatives about topics Americans find most important. Reaching out to House and Senate represenatives may take a while as you will have to individually go to each represenatives page and fill in lot's of info before submitting. Thus CivicConnect streamlines this process. <br><br> Adding on, in-depth research is done to provide email templates available to all users, taking the time-consuming task of sifting through sources out of being civically engaged. The pre-written emails can be sent in a few easy clicks or can be edited to the user’s liking. By connecting citizens with Congress, the American people can be the deciders of their nation’s future.</p>
